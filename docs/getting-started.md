# Getting Started

1. Download the [example template](../resources/example.libraryhtmltemplate.zip).
1. In the Delicious Library publishing view, right-click (or control-click) the template list, choose "Open Templates Directory", and put the (unzipped) example template in there. As you edit the template's HTML file, Delicious Library's preview should update live.

For more examples, take a look at the built-in templates inside the "Delicious Library 3.app" package.
